README
=========================================================================================================
Changes:  
  - new option "Store PNG-preview" in the Batch-render ("m3p->m3i") to save an additional *.PNG preview, which is default set to on
  - FIXED: improved the stability of the Preview in BTracer2 which could be trapped inside an endless loop when it was flooed with too many refresh-events
  - FIXED: Saving PNG16Bit to locations with spaces in the path failed, also when the path to the Mandelbulb3D.exe itself contained space characters
  - FIXED: the file dialog used for regular images also displayed the 16bit option (which is only supported for z-buffers)
  - showing the url of the official web site in the log file

See the file CHANGES.txt for a complete list of all changes. 
See other README_xxx.txt files for other useful information.
